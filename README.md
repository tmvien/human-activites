## Summary

Please refer to the analysis report and R code as above.

Most of us have been familiar and seen technology devices like Fitbit or Apple Watch. They are all-in-one
fitness bands, smartwatches and accesories that can monitor, track human activities for steps, exercise, heart
rates, weights and many more. Those devices are primarily using accelerometer and gyroscope which are
triaxial sensors to generate a signal which can be processed and analized as an activity. In this project, we
would like to use sequences of signals recorded by smart phones for building a machine learning classifier of
detecting Human Activities.
